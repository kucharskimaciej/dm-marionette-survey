# Marionette Survey

This is the example application for Backbone + Marionette training created in cooperation with **Developerspeak.com**

## How to build

I expect you to have `npm`m `gulp` and `bower` installed *globally* on your machine. Steps required to build the app:

`npm install && bower install`
`gulp build`

## How to run

First see instruction on how to build the app. Then run:

`gulp server`

This will open a new browser tab with the app loaded.
